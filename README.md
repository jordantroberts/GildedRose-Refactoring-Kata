# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

I did this kata as part of Makers Academy Week 10 tech tests in order to test my ability to read, test and refactor legacy code.

## The requirements

Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city run by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods. Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures. Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that we can begin selling a new category of items. First an introduction to our system:

All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item. All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is. At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item. Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:

* Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
* The Quality of an item is never negative
* “Aged Brie” actually increases in Quality the older it gets
* The Quality of an item is never more than 50
* “Sulfuras”, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
* “Backstage passes”, like aged brie, increases in Quality as it’s SellIn value approaches; Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but Quality drops to 0 after the concert
We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:

“Conjured” items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items

Feel free to make any changes to the UpdateQuality method and add any new code as long as everything still works correctly. However, do not alter the Item class or Items property as those belong to the goblin in the corner who will insta-rage and one-shot you as he doesn’t believe in shared code ownership (you can make the UpdateQuality method and Items property static if you like, we’ll cover for you)

## My approach

1. After reading the requirements I wrote tests for the different elements in order to make sure that any refactoring I did would not break the legacy code.

2. I then spent time attempting to get my head around the existing legacy code. As expected, it was very difficult to read, understand and change due to the nested conditionals and lack of extraction.

3. In order to follow the DRY principle I tidied up code that had been repeated.

4. In order to follow the Single Responsibility Principle, I extracted lots of the code to different methods in order to make it easier to read and understand.

5. I added the new conjured items functionality. The code still needed some refactoring so I then spent time tidying up the 'update_quality' method to reduce the amount of nested conditionals.
